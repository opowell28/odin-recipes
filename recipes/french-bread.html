    <h2>Dutch Oven French Bread</h2>
    <p>This is my favorite bread recipe by far. It's easy, relatively quick, and delicious. 
        The Dutch oven gives the bread a really nice crust all over, while still cooking it evenly inside for a nice, soft bread.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>400 grams</strong> bread flower</li>
        <li><strong>300 grams</strong> warm water</li>
        <li><strong>9 grams</strong> active dry yeast</li>
        <li><strong>8 grams</strong> salt</li>
        <li><strong>4 grams</strong> honey</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine <em>yeast</em>, <em>sugar</em>, and <em>warm water</em> in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Let the <em>yeast</em> get foamy, which should take about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix until the dough begins to come together, then add the <em>salt</em>.</li>
        <li>Mix until dough fully forms and is relatively smooth.</li>
        <li>Cover bowl with a towel and let rise for one hour.</li>
        <li>Once dough is risen, tip onto a floured surface. <strong>DO NOT PUNCH DOWN.</strong></li>
        <li>Pull each corner into the center until the dough feels tight when pulled.</li>
        <li>Flip over so the seam side is down and form into a round loaf.</li>
        <li>Let rise (seam-side down) for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place Dutch oven into the oven and preheat to 460Â°F.</li>
        <li>Once oven is preheated, place bread on a piece of parchment paper and <strong>carefully</strong> lower into the Dutch oven.</li>
        <li>Bake for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove lid and bake for another 10 - 15 minutes until top of loaf is golden brown.</li>
    </ol>
